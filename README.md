Loan Default Prediction Modelling for an imbalanced dataset
# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. 
It addresses a critical problem in the financial sector; reducing credit risk by identifying high-risk borrowers before loan approval.

By applying machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest (with resampling techniques like SMOTE), the project aims to build a predictive system that improves recall and F1-score, especially for the minority class (loan defaulters).


## Dataset

- **Source**: Coursera's Loan Default Prediction Challenge
- **Rows**: 255,347  
- **Columns**: 18  
- **Type**: Structured tabular data

The dataset simulates real-world loan data with features that include applicant demographics, financial history, credit scores, and loan characteristics. The target variable indicates whether a customer **defaulted** (`1`) or **did not default** (`0`).


## Problem Statement

Loan defaulting is a major financial risk. Traditional accuracy-based models fail to detect defaulters due to class imbalance (most customers donâ€™t default). Hence, this project focuses on **F1-score** and **recall** for the minority class using advanced resampling and model tuning techniques.

##  Key Results

- Applied **SMOTE** to improve model performance on minority class
